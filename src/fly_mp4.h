/**
 * @file fly_mp4.h
 *
 * The MP4 tag header file for pianobarfly.
 *
 * This is a limited implementation of MP4 tags designed specifically for 
 * pianobarfly needs.  Specifically this implmentation does not allow editing or
 * deleting of tags.  It only allows adding of tags to a file for which it is
 * assumed no metadata tags exist.  Once added a tag cannot be edited.  For
 * example you can not add the artist tag then later decide to change it by
 * re-adding it.
 *
 * To sum it up do not use this API to edit MP4 metadata.  It will screw up the
 * file!
